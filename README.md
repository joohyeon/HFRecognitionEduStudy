# HF Recognition Study - Randomized Trial

**Title:** Artificial Intelligence and Guideline-Based Medical Education Tools for Enhancing Heart Failure Recognition with Medical Students: A Randomized Trial

**A short description:** Artificial intelligence (AI) tools to enhance medical education activities, such as clinical pattern recognition, present substantial promise. Yet, the degree to which such tools may complement traditional approaches built from established clinical guidelines remains understudied. To address this, we conducted a trial to investigate the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) and guideline-based recommendations embedded into electronic health record data, focusing on recognizing patients with heart failure as a clinically relevant use case.
